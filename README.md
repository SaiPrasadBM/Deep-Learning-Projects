## 1. Predicting Bike-Sharing Data
<p>
Building and training my own Neural Network from scratch to predict the number of
bike-share users on a given day which gave better understanding of gradient descent
and backpropagation.

You can access the data set from here: Bike Sharing Dataset Data Set

## 2. Dog Breed Classifier (CNN project)
<p>
Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed
which helped in learning how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied
images.

## 3. Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews
<p>
Analysis to predict which movie reviews are positive and negative which helped in
understanding ineffciencies & reducing noise in the neural network.
